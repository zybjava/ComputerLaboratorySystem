### How to start
> To create your own project, just open your terminal, but create your own folder for a project. Next is execute this command to your terminal:
```Bash
npm init - y
```
> Next is install the dependencies: `express`, `cors`, `body-parser`, `nodemon`, `sqlite3`, and `npx`. The dependencies are all visible, kindly check. Next is to create a react app, just execute this code:
```Bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```
